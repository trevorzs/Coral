Background
Generative Art is a concept that refers to art that is created at least partly by an automated or autonomous system. It can refer to art being primarily driven by complex algorithms or a mixture of machine and user input. This simulation will attempt to create generative art that will be altered based on user input. An algorithm will generate a series of coral which the user can interact with. Clicking on a coral will cause a new set of coral to be generated, based on the "genetics" of the coral that was clicked, simulating a type of generative evolution.

Functionality and MVP
Click on a button to reset and reseed initial coral with randomized properties
Click on a coral to generate a new set of coral based on clicked coral's "genetics"

Wireframes
This app will consist of a single screen with a simple canvas. The canvas will have a reset button, and contain a series of 8 coral that can be clicked on. Additionally, there will be a button linking to my Github.

Architecture and Technologies
Processing.js for rendering generative designs

Implementation Timeline
Day 1:
Learn enough Processing.js to generate simple designs

Day 2:
Implement generation of initial seed coral, designate "phenotypes" and "genotypes"

Day 3:
Implement generation of new generations of coral

Day 4:
User interactivity and decoration of canvas (sea theme)
